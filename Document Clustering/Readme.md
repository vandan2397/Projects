# IMPLEMENTATION OF CLUSTERING TECHNIQUES ON TEXT DATASET

![Graphical Abstract 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55615788/136470685-23a58104-a90e-46a1-b5bf-4847e52e23b4.jpg)

### Introduction
Clustering documents is fruitful when you have large number of documents and you want to extract documents of specific category. But, the question arises that how much accurate the documents are clustered. So to answer the question, I conducted this project. This Project addresses the research question of the performance of two different clustering algorithms i.e. K-Means and DBSCAN using two different similarity measures(cosine and Hybrid).

### Methods Used
- Text Similarity
- Text Clustering
- Machine Learning

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sklearn
- Jupyter IDE

### Flow of project

<b>1) Data Collection</b>
-
<b>2) Data Acquisition </b>

<b>3) Data Pre-processing </b>

<b>4) Tf-Idf matrix generation and document index graph generation</b>

<b>5) Similarity Calculation between documents </b>

<b>6) Optimal parameter values calculation </b>

<b>7) Clustering(K-Means & DBSCAN)</b>
